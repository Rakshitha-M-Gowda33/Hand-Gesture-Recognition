# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Objective

The goal of this task is to develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. This enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

Dataset

Hand gesture images or video frames representing various gestures (e.g., thumbs up, open palm, peace sign).

Each gesture is labeled for supervised learning.

(Optional) If the dataset is large, you can provide a link or instructions to generate it using MediaPipe.

Steps Followed

Data Collection & Exploration

Gathered images/videos of different hand gestures.

Checked for missing or corrupted frames and analyzed gesture variety.

Data Preprocessing

Resized and normalized images for consistency.

Annotated gestures for training the classifier.

Optionally extracted hand landmarks using MediaPipe for better feature representation.

Model Building

Implemented a gesture recognition model using MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and a classifier (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Network).

Trained the model on labeled gesture data.

Evaluation

Measured accuracy and analyzed confusion matrix on the training dataset.

Evaluated model capability to distinguish multiple gestures.

Output

Labeled gestures detected from images or video frames.

(Optional) Visualization of hand landmarks for better interpretability.

Accuracy and performance metrics for gesture classification.

Key Takeaways

Hand gesture recognition improves human-computer interaction and forms the basis of gesture-based control systems.

Combining MediaPipe landmarks with a machine learning classifier allows accurate gesture classification.

Preprocessing and feature extraction are critical for reliable real-time detection.
